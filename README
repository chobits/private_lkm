What?
  Some linux kernel module examples
  All the examples are written when I try to hack linux kernel.

Usage?
  I think the best way to learn linux kernel is to
   read the fucking source code(RFSC).
  But writing real code to hack kernel is benefit for
   you to understand the kernel source.
  Linux kernel module(LKM) gives us a good chance to write
   our own code into kernel.
